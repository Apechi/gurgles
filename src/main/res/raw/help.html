<h1>Gurgle</h1>
<h2>Guess those words</h2>
<p>
  Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the <b>Back</b> key
  to backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap the <b>Enter</b> key.
</p>
<h2>Display colours</h2>
<p>
  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. Keep
  trying until you have guessed the word. The display will start again
  from the top if you run out of guesses.
</p>
<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>
  Tap the <b>Refresh</b> button in the toolbar to clear the display and
  guess another word. Words are chosen at random from a list, and are
  checked that they haven't been used recently.
