<h2>Guess those words</h2>

  Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the <b>Back</b>
  key to backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap
  the <b>Enter</b> key. If you have guessed the word correctly, tap
  the <b>Gurgle</b> icon for the definition of the word.

<h2>Display colours</h2>

  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they

  guessed the word. The display will start again from the top if you
  run out of guesses.
