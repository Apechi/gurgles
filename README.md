Fairly simple android word game.

## Guess those words
Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the **Back** key to
backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap the **Enter** key. If
you have guessed the word correctly, tap the **Gurgle** icon for the
definition of the word.

## Display colours
Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they
are not in the word they will turn grey. Keep trying until you have
guessed the word. The display will start again from the top if you run
out of guesses.

## Refresh
Tap the **Refresh** button in the toolbar to clear the display and
guess another word. Words are chosen at random from a list, and are
checked that they haven't been used recently.

## Meaning
Tap the word once it has been guessed to display the meaning.

## Cheat
Use my [Crossword](https://github.com/billthefarmer/crossword) app to
cheat.
