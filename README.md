## Guess those words
Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the **Back** key to
backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap the **Enter** key.

## Display colours
Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. Keep
trying until you have guessed the word. The display will start again
from the top if you run out of guesses.

## Refresh
Tap the **Refresh** button in the toolbar to clear the display and
guess another word. Words are chosen at random from a list, and are
checked that they haven't been used recently.
