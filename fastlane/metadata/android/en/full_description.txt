Guess those words

Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the Back key to backspace. When you have finished a guess, tap the Enter key.

Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they are not in the word they will turn grey. Keep trying until you have guessed the word. The display will start again from the top if you run out of guesses.

Tap the Refresh button in the toolbar to clear the display and guess another word. Words are chosen at random from a list, and are checked that they haven't been used recently.
